**#Product Application**

  The Product CRUD application is designed to manage product information using a full-stack approach with Spring MVC, Spring Boot, Spring Data JPA, and Thymeleaf for the frontend.
The application allows users to perform basic CRUD operations: Create, Read, Update, and Delete products. It follows the Model-View-Controller (MVC) design pattern,
separating concerns between the data model, user interface, and the business logic. Spring Boot powers the backend, providing a robust and scalable foundation for creating RESTful APIs and handling the
product data management. Spring Data JPA simplifies the database interactions, reducing boilerplate code by automating common database operations like saving, retrieving, updating, and deleting records.
The application also uses Thymeleaf, a modern server-side Java template engine, to dynamically render the HTML frontend and interact seamlessly with the backend. Users can add new products, view existing products
in a list, edit product details, and remove products, all via a responsive and intuitive web interface. 

   The use of Thymeleaf ensures that the frontend is dynamically updated as users interact with the application,
creating a smooth user experience. The backend is built with Spring Bootâ€™s simplicity in mind, enabling easy setup and rapid development while keeping the application modular and maintainable. The system is easily
extendable, allowing for future features like product categorization, inventory management, and user authentication. This application showcases the power of Spring technologies to build a functional, user-friendly,
and maintainable CRUD application.
